# Simon_Game-
üéÆ Simon Game
This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game, a popular memory game that challenges users to remember and repeat an increasingly long sequence of patterns. In this game, a sequence of colored buttons lights up in a specific order, and the player must repeat the exact sequence by clicking the buttons in the same pattern. If the player successfully repeats the sequence, a new pattern is added, and the game continues. The goal is to follow the pattern as long as possible without making a mistake.

The original Simon Game was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison and was first released by Milton Bradley in 1978.

This version of the Simon Game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a fun and interactive way to test and improve memory skills.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **HTML5** ‚Äì for semantic structuring and layout of game elements.
- **CSS3** ‚Äì for styling, user interface design, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì for implementing all core functionalities, including:
  - Generating and managing pattern sequences
  - Handling game states and user input
  - Triggering animations and sound effects
- **jQuery** ‚Äì for simplified DOM manipulation and event handling (a JavaScript library used in this project).

## üß† What I Learned

- Gained hands-on experience in **managing game logic using JavaScript**, including conditional checks, array handling, and sequence validation.
- Learned to **trigger animations and sound effects dynamically** using JavaScript based on user actions and game events.
- Practiced **DOM manipulation and real-time interactivity** using both JavaScript and **jQuery**, reinforcing efficient event handling techniques.
- Improved my understanding of **responsive design principles** through CSS, ensuring cross-device compatibility.
- Applied **modular and scalable coding practices**, making the project easy to maintain and extend in the future.
- Strengthened debugging and testing skills through iterative development and handling user-driven edge cases.
